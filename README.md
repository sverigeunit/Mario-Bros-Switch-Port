# Mario NES for Nintendo Switch

This is a port of Super Mario Bros to the Nintendo Switch. This port was written in C and SDL. Although it is not a true re-written port, this project emulates a NES on the switch to run this game at near original performance(on actual hardware). This port was made for fun and to learn more about emulation. The use cases for this port are really slim but it is fun to play.

You can run the nro release on your nintendo switch or on the yuzu emulator. You can build it if you have devkit pro. If you are building the game then you need to put a rom.nes file in romfs/data. 

Right here is a gif of the port on an emulator.
