# Mario NES for Nintendo Switch

This is a port of Super Mario Bros to the Nintendo Switch. This port was written in C and SDL. Although it is not a true re-written port, this project emulates a NES on the switch to run this game at near original performance(on actual hardware). If you are asking why I made this port, it is because people with hacked nintendo switches can't play their nes librarys. This gives those people easy access to the original Super Mario Bros because of that.

The port lacks sound and it has abelow decent performance but other than that...it is great!! You can run the nro release on your nintendo switch or on the yuzu emulator. You can build it if you have devkit pro. If you are building the game then you need to put a rom.nes file in romfs/data. If you want the rom file then contact me at 25ratcma@protonmail.com if you own the original Super Mario Bros.

Right here is a gif of the port on an emulator.
